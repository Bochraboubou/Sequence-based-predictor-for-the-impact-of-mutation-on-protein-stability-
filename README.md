# Sequence-based-predictor-for-the-impact-of-mutation-on-protein-stability-
This project focuses on developing a sequence-based predictor to assess the impact of mutations on protein stability. The thermodynamic folding stability, represented by ΔΔG (DDG), will be predicted, providing valuable insights into how a single amino acid mutation affects the protein's overall stability.
